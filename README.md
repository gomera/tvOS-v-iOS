# tvOS-v-iOS
A trivial and simple demonstration about the almost non-existing differences between tvOS and iOS. Please keep in mind that this is not a state of the art code and should be used at your own risk. The primary goal it's to be shown during [NSConfAr 2016](http://nsconfarg.com/) as a demo app.


## Setup
You will need to initialize the server located on the client folder pointing to http://localhost:8080

For example 

```
php -S localhost:8080
```

## Extra notes
The movies are pointing to Youtube links, if by anyreason you found that the movies are not working for you, double check those links.
